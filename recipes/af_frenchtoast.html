        <h3>Delightfully crispy-toasted on the outside, and soft in the center, Air Fryer French Toast is as delicious as it is easy to make!</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>11 teaspoom grpund cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoom vanilla extract</li>
            <li>8 slices of bread</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all of the ingredients, except the bread, to a shallow dish and whisk well to combine (or add to a blender and blend until smooth).</li>
        <li>Cut each slice of bread into into three pieces/sticks(or you can leave the bread slices whole, if you'd like). Spray the fry basket with non stick spray before each batch.</li>
        <li>Dip each piece of bread into the egg mixture, dredging well on both sides, and then place in the fry basket, leaving a little space between each one and laying them in a single later.  Be careful not to overcrowd them or they will not get crispy. (You may need to cook them in 3-4 batches, depending on the size of your air fryer)</li>
        <li>Air fry at 350 degrees F for 4 minutes then flip them over (separating them from each other if they stick together) and cook for 3-4 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with homemade syrup or maple syrup.</li>
        
    </ol>
